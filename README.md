## About Wordtangle

The project was created for the course "Product design and implementation 2023" by a group consisting of five:

- [@Tinosaurus](https://github.com/Tinosaurus)
- [@Raitokomniak](https://github.com/Raitokomniak)
- [@pahvone](https://github.com/pahvone)
- [@t1rima00](https://github.com/t1rima00)
- [@Shambambulish](https://github.com/Shambambulish)

The idea for the application is that the user can learn languages, have fun while learning the languages
and can connect to other users to help/receive help via the forums.

The goal for the project was for the group to work together as a team, learning new skills
and creating a working web-application which would be hosted on an external site.
